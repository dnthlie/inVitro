## 1. Introduction: 
In Vitro is a text-based adventure RPG where the player assumes the role of a human test subject attempting to escape an alien spaceship after being abducted. 
The game is designed for people who enjoy story driven role playing games, puzzle-solving, and eerie retro aesthetics inspired by classic CRT terminals and sci-fi environments.

## 2. Functional Requirements 
- All character actions must be executed through typed commands entered into a terminal interface. 
- Typical inputs include a single action or an action followed by an object (e.g., “go right”, “grab shovel”). 
- The Entire Game must take place in a UI with a retro CRT style terminal. The top portion of the screen displays images representing the player’s current environment, and the bottom portion will feature the terminal input and output. 
- There must be an inventory system that is displayed through a typed command. It should show all the items currently carried by the player and allow them to quickly use the items. 
- The gameplay should be centered around solving puzzles to gain access to new areas.
- There should be multiple different endings that are determined by the choices that the player decides to make.There should be Good, Neutral, and Bad endings. 
- The game should include hidden easter eggs to add charm and humor amidst the otherwise ominous tone.

## 3. Nonfunctional Requirements
